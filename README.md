AntSolverGUI
============

AntSolver is a Windows 64 bit program that solves TSP files. As developed by Gareth Hunter for my dissertation submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements of Dublin Institute of Technology for the degree of
M.Sc. in Computing (Advanced Software Engineering) "Ants find the shortest path" 2014

Implemented is 6 differnet Ant Colonly Algorithms , and the genetic algorithm in one framework, and displays visual feeback of the inner workings of each algorithm.

AntSolver is implemented in C++ and the main algorithm classes have been implemented using standard C++ , therefore enabling these classes to be imported to any other C++ application on any operating system. 
Although Visual C++ 10 professional with service Pack 2 installed was used to compile this version. 

** To compile download to desktop computer and open AntSolver.vcxproj in visual C++ 10 **

1.	The main algorithm classes, the entire logic of all the ant algorithms, and genetic algorithm have been encapsulated into these classes. All are accessed via an interface and created via a factory;
2.	A Local search module with the methods of local search is discussed and can be applied to each solution of each algorithm (except the brute force algorithm); 
3.	The Problem module implements the Travelling Salesperson Problem to demonstrate the flexibility of these algorithms; 
4.	A GUI interface module was created to visualise the algorithms and a MS Windows 64bit and 32 bit GUI interface to the algorithms classes was built with MFC compiled using Visual C++ 10;

In compiling AntSolver the following code was used to provide access to MS Excel SimpleXlsxWriter 
A Thomas St√ºtzle/Lin Kernighan local search was also added.
